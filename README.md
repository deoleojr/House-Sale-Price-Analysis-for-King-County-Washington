## Synopsis
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing house sale prices for King County, Washington, including Seattle. The data includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The analysis will address two questions of interest: one involving linear regression with a quantitative response variable and another involving logistic regression with a binary response variable. Data visualizations will be produced to support the analysis, and the report will provide a comprehensive discussion of the findings.
